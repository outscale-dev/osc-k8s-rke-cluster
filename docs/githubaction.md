# Github Actions
Severals actions are available to be able to use it in the CI:
 -  [deploy_cluster](../github_actions/deploy_cluster/README.md)
 -  [destroy_cluster](../github_actions/destroy_cluster/README.md)

It is recommended that both Github Actions are used otherwise you will either have resources leaks or failure during destruction of the cluster.
